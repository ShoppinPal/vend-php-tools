==================

This is a labor of love. This effort is not funded, endorsed or sponsored by Vend.

This module is being written out of sheer respect for Vend's uncanny success at platformizing retail with their public API. It will hopefully help democratize access further by adding ease of use for developers. The authors of this module are not Vend employees and Vend didn't ask us to do this. Retail is a tricky/competitive space and we want to help reduce development churn, by open-sourcing pieces that allow folks to build iterative solutions. When in doubt, be sure to pay attention to the details expressed in the LICENSE file.
